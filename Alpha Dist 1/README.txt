----- HOW TO USE THIS PIECE OF SHIT -----

    1. open a file
    2. create your title and subtitle, and story
        - if you don't want the subtitle (or title?), just delete all text in the text box
    3. position the subtitle or title by dragging them
    4. click render, and choose the file you'd like to save it as (see warnings below)


----- !!! WARNINGS !!! -----

    - There are 500ms delays with updating the preview. 

    - Rendering takes upwards of 30 seconds. WAIT UNTIL THE LOADING ICON NEXT TO THE RENDER BUTTON HAS TURNED INTO A CHECK-MARK IMAGE BEFORE TRYING TO OPEN THE FILE!!!

    - I wouldn't recommend trying to open and use two or more instances of the software at once. It will clear a temporary folder that the previous instance needs, and your stuff will be lost.
    
    - JUST IN CASE, I would recommend backing up each gif you edit. There shouldn't be any problems, but you can never be too safe.
